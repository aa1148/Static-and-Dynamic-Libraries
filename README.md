# Static-and-Dynamic-Libraries
Included are two libraries: A Static library (.h) with functions to convert from a string of characters in different formats (binary, floating point, hexadecimal) to the actual real value, and a Dynamic library (.dll) with a function that will read an extremely large string, allocating memory as the string demands it.
